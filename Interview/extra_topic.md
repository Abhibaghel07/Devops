### 1. Data Engineering (10 Questions)

1. **What is an ETL pipeline, and how do you build one?**
   - **Answer**: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes data from sources to destinations. Example in Python:
     ```python
     import pandas as pd
     import sqlite3
     # Extract
     df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
     # Transform
     df['price'] = df['price'].fillna(df['price'].mean())
     # Load
     conn = sqlite3.connect('output.db')
     df.to_sql('products', conn, if_exists='replace')
     ```
     Orchestrate with Airflow.
   - **DevOps Context**: Automates data workflows.

2. **What’s the difference between a data lake and a data warehouse?**
   - **Answer**: A data lake stores raw, unstructured data for flexible analysis (e.g., ML), while a data warehouse stores structured, optimized data for BI. Example: Use a lake for logs and a warehouse for sales reports.
   - **DevOps Context**: Guides storage architecture.

3. **How do you handle large datasets in Python?**
   - **Answer**: Use Pandas with chunking or Dask for parallel processing. Example:
     ```python
     import pandas as pd
     for chunk in pd.read_csv('large.csv', chunksize=10000):
         chunk = chunk.dropna()
         chunk.to_parquet('output.parquet', append=True)
     ```
   - **DevOps Context**: Ensures scalability.

4. **What is Apache Airflow, and how do you use it?**
   - **Answer**: Airflow schedules and monitors workflows. Example DAG:
     ```python
     from airflow import DAG
     from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
     from datetime import datetime
     def process_data():
         print("Processing data")
     with DAG('my_dag', start_date=datetime(2025, 1, 1), schedule_interval='@daily') as dag:
         task = PythonOperator(task_id='process', python_callable=process_data)
     ```
     Run with `airflow scheduler`.
   - **DevOps Context**: Automates ETL pipelines.

5. **How do you optimize SQL queries for large datasets?**
   - **Answer**: Use indexes, partition tables, and avoid SELECT *. Example:
     ```sql
     CREATE INDEX idx_date ON sales (sale_date);
     SELECT product_id, SUM(amount) FROM sales WHERE sale_date > '2025-01-01' GROUP BY product_id;
     ```
   - **DevOps Context**: Improves data pipeline performance.

6. **What are data formats like Parquet and Avro, and why use them?**
   - **Answer**: Parquet is columnar for analytics, and Avro is row-based with schema evolution. Example:
     ```python
     import pandas as pd
     df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
     df.to_parquet('data.parquet')
     ```
     Use Parquet for Spark, Avro for Kafka.
   - **DevOps Context**: Optimizes storage and processing.

7. **How do you handle data quality in pipelines?**
   - **Answer**: Implement validation checks (e.g., null checks, range checks). Example:
     ```python
     import pandas as pd
     df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
     if df['price'].isnull().any():
         raise ValueError("Null prices detected")
     ```
     Use Great Expectations for advanced validation.
   - **DevOps Context**: Ensures reliable data.

8. **What is a data pipeline orchestration tool?**
   - **Answer**: Tools like Airflow or Prefect schedule and monitor data workflows. Example:
     ```bash
     pip install apache-airflow
     airflow db init
     ```
     Define DAGs for ETL tasks.
   - **DevOps Context**: Centralizes pipeline management.

9. **How do you integrate a data pipeline with Kubernetes?**
   - **Answer**: Deploy Airflow on Kubernetes with Helm. Example:
     ```bash
     helm install airflow apache-airflow/airflow --namespace data
     ```
     Use Kubernetes Executor for scalability.
   - **DevOps Context**: Leverages container orchestration.

10. **What are the challenges of real-time data pipelines?**
    - **Answer**: Challenges include latency, data consistency, and fault tolerance. Use tools like Kafka or Spark Streaming. Example:
      ```python
      from kafka import KafkaConsumer
      consumer = KafkaConsumer('my-topic', bootstrap_servers=['localhost:9092'])
      for msg in consumer:
          print(msg.value)
      ```
    - **DevOps Context**: Requires robust monitoring.

### 2. Generative AI (10 Questions)

1. **What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?**
   - **Answer**: An LLM is a neural network trained on text to generate human-like responses (e.g., GPT-2). Example:
     ```python
     from transformers import pipeline
     generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2')
     print(generator('Hello', max_length=50))
     ```
   - **DevOps Context**: Used in automation tools.

2. **What is prompt engineering, and why is it important?**
   - **Answer**: Prompt engineering crafts inputs to guide LLMs for accurate outputs. Example: “Summarize DevOps in 50 words” vs. “Explain DevOps.” Clear prompts reduce ambiguity.
   - **DevOps Context**: Enhances automation scripts.

3. **How do you integrate an LLM into an application?**
   - **Answer**: Use Hugging Face or APIs like OpenAI. Example:
     ```python
     from flask import Flask, request
     from transformers import pipeline
     app = Flask(__name__)
     generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2')
     @app.route('/generate', methods=['POST'])
     def generate():
         prompt = request.json['prompt']
         output = generator(prompt, max_length=50)
         return {'text': output[0]['generated_text']}
     app.run()
     ```
   - **DevOps Context**: Deploy with Docker/Kubernetes.

4. **What are the challenges of using LLMs in production?**
   - **Answer**: High compute costs, latency, bias, and privacy. Mitigate with model quantization, caching, and compliance checks.
   - **DevOps Context**: Requires optimization and monitoring.

5. **How do you fine-tune an LLM?**
   - **Answer**: Train an LLM on domain-specific data using Hugging Face. Example:
     ```python
     from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments
     # Load model and dataset
     training_args = TrainingArguments(output_dir='./results', num_train_epochs=3)
     trainer = Trainer(model=model, args=training_args, train_dataset=dataset)
     trainer.train()
     ```
   - **DevOps Context**: Needs GPU resources and CI/CD.

6. **What is LangChain, and how do you use it?**
   - **Answer**: LangChain chains LLM calls for complex tasks. Example:
     ```python
     from langchain.llms import OpenAI
     llm = OpenAI(api_key='your-key')
     response = llm('Summarize Kubernetes in 50 words')
     print(response)
     ```
   - **DevOps Context**: Automates workflows.

7. **How do you evaluate LLM performance?**
   - **Answer**: Use metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, or human evaluation. Example: Compare generated text to reference text for accuracy.
   - **DevOps Context**: Ensures quality in production.

8. **How do you deploy an LLM on Kubernetes?**
   - **Answer**: Use a containerized model with a serving framework (e.g., KServe). Example:
     ```bash
     helm install my-llm kserve/kserve --set model.image=my-llm:1.0
     ```
     Scale with HPA.
   - **DevOps Context**: Leverages orchestration.

9. **What are ethical considerations in GenAI?**
   - **Answer**: Bias, misinformation, and privacy. Mitigate with diverse training data and transparency. Example: Audit model outputs for fairness.
   - **DevOps Context**: Aligns with compliance.

10. **How can GenAI assist DevOps tasks?**
    - **Answer**: Generate manifests, analyze logs, or automate documentation. Example:
      ```python
      from transformers import pipeline
      generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2')
      prompt = 'Generate a Kubernetes Service manifest'
      print(generator(prompt, max_length=200))
      ```
    - **DevOps Context**: Boosts productivity.
