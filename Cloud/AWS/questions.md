# Core AWS VPC Interview Questions (1–45)

## VPC Basics & Components
1.	What is a VPC in AWS? Why is it used?
	A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. It enables complete control over networking.
2.	Main components of a VPC:
	•	Subnets
	•	Route Tables
	•	Internet Gateway (IGW)
	•	NAT Gateway
	•	Network ACLs (NACLs)
	•	Security Groups
	•	VPC Peering
	•	Elastic IPs
	•	Endpoints
3.	Public vs Private Subnet:
	•	Public subnet has a route to an Internet Gateway.
	•	Private subnet doesn’t have a route to the IGW.
4.	How does a private instance access the internet?
	Via a NAT Gateway/Instance placed in a public subnet with route configured.
5.	What is an Internet Gateway? Can you have more than one?
	IGW is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet.
	❌ Only one IGW per VPC.
6.	What is a NAT Gateway? How is it different from NAT Instance?
	NAT Gateway is a managed, scalable AWS service. NAT Instance is a self-managed EC2 instance.
	•	NAT Gateway is preferred for high availability and performance.
7.	Limitations of NAT Instance vs NAT Gateway:
	•	NAT Instances require manual scaling and patching.
	•	NAT Gateway offers better throughput, redundancy, and automation.
8.	Default VPC — use in production?
	No. Always create a custom VPC in production for better isolation and control.
9.	Subnets per VPC & spanning AZs?
	•	Max 200 subnets per VPC by default.
	•	A subnet resides in one AZ only.
10.	Can CIDR block be modified after VPC creation?
	Yes. You can add secondary CIDR blocks, but can’t change the primary.

## Routing & Access

11.	Connect two VPCs in different regions:
	Use VPC Peering (cross-region) or Transit Gateway for complex multi-VPC communication.
12.	Multiple route tables with a subnet?
	❌ Only one route table can be associated per subnet.
13.	Troubleshooting SSH to private EC2:
	•	Check route tables
	•	Bastion host setup
	•	SG/NACL rules
	•	Correct private key
	•	EC2 health/state

14.	Restrict internet access to private subnet:
	•	Remove NAT Gateway route
	•	Set deny rules in NACLs

15.	Delete IGW — what happens?
	All instances in public subnets lose internet access.
16.	Subnet accessing another VPC?

	•	Yes, via VPC Peering, Transit Gateway, or PrivateLink

17.	VPC Peering vs Transit Gateway:

	•	Peering is 1:1, no transitive routing.
	•	TGW supports transitive routing, hub-and-spoke model.

18.	Connect on-prem to AWS:

	•	Use Site-to-Site VPN, AWS Direct Connect, or Transit Gateway.

19.	DNS in VPC:

	•	AmazonProvidedDNS resolves internal DNS.
	•	Enable/disable via DHCP options.

20.	Asymmetric routing issue?
	Check reverse path in route table, NAT Gateway/IGW routes, NACLs.

## Security
21.	Security Group vs Network ACL:

	•	SG = stateful, instance-level
	•	NACL = stateless, subnet-level

22.	Which is stateful/stateless?

	•	SG = Stateful
	•	NACL = Stateless

23.	Can SG be assigned to subnet?
	❌ No. SGs are attached to ENIs (i.e., EC2 instances).
24.	Restrict SSH to one private EC2:

	•	Use Bastion Host in public subnet
	•	SG allows only Bastion’s private IP

25.	Restrict EC2 access to specific ports/IPs:

	•	Use SG rules (source IP, port range)

26.	Deny rules in SGs?
	❌ SGs only allow rules.
	✅ Deny rules are possible in NACLs.

27.	Inbound vs Outbound in SG/NACLs:

	•	SG: both needed (stateful)
	•	NACL: must explicitly allow both directions

⸻

## Troubleshooting & Monitoring
28.	Private instance can’t access internet:

	•	Check subnet routes
	•	NAT Gateway present and working
	•	SGs/NACLs allow outbound
	•	No overlapping CIDR

29.	What is MTU in VPC?
	Maximum Transmission Unit (usually 1500 bytes).
	Check logs or use ping -s to test fragmentation.
30.	VPC communication latency:

	•	Use VPC Flow Logs
	•	CloudWatch metrics
	•	Enhanced Networking (ENA)

⸻

## Automation & Environment Design
31.	Provision VPC via Terraform/CFN:
	Use IaC to define VPC, subnets, route tables, gateways, etc.
32.	Manage multiple environments:

	•	Use Terraform workspaces or different variable sets
	•	Isolate via separate VPCs or CIDR ranges

33.	Terraform modules for VPC:

	•	terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws
	•	Reusable, parameterized module

34.	Isolate environments securely:

	•	Use different VPCs or subnets
	•	Apply proper SGs, NACLs, VPC endpoints

⸻

## Design & Scalability
35.	HA across AZs:

	•	Subnets in multiple AZs
	•	Multi-AZ NAT Gateways
	•	Load balancers spanning AZs

36.	Subnetting best practices:

	•	Reserve separate CIDR blocks per AZ
	•	Avoid overlap
	•	Size subnets according to growth

37.	Multiple CIDR blocks for VPC:

	•	Yes, to expand IP range
	•	Must not overlap

38.	Why multiple route tables?

	•	Fine-grained control
	•	Different routes for public/private/data subnets

39.	AWS PrivateLink vs Peering:

	•	PrivateLink = one-way, service-based access
	•	Peering = two-way traffic between VPCs

⸻

## Logs & Observability
40.	What is VPC Flow Logs?

	•	Logs all IP traffic in/out of network interfaces
	•	Used for troubleshooting, monitoring, compliance

41.	Tools for monitoring VPC traffic:

	•	VPC Flow Logs
	•	CloudWatch
	•	3rd party NPM tools (e.g., Datadog, Wireshark)

42.	Network segmentation in VPC:

	•	Subnets, route tables, NACLs
	•	Separate security groups

43.	Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs):

	•	Virtual NICs
	•	Allow multiple IPs, flexibility during scaling/failover

44.	Default vs custom route tables:

	•	Default = attached to subnets by default
	•	Custom = used for specific routing needs

45.	Secure VPC Endpoints:

	•	Use interface endpoints for private connectivity
	•	Restrict via security groups and policies

⸻

## VPC Peering & Site-to-Site VPN (46–55)
46.	What is VPC Peering?
	A networking connection between two VPCs to route traffic using private IPs.
47.	Cross-account / cross-region VPC Peering?
	✅ Supported

	•	Requires manual or automated setup in both VPCs
	•	Route tables must be updated

48.	Transitive routing in VPC Peering?
	❌ Not supported
	Must use Transit Gateway for that.
49.	CIDR overlap in peering?
	❌ Peering will fail if CIDRs overlap.
50.	Limitations of VPC Peering:

	•	No transitive routing
	•	Limited to 125 peering connections per VPC (default)
	•	Must update routes manually

51.	Route table configuration in VPC Peering:
	Each side must add routes to the other VPC’s CIDR via the peering connection.
52.	Secure VPC Peering traffic:
	Use SGs and NACLs
	Private IP traffic only
53.	Billing in VPC Peering:

	•	Data transfer between AZs is charged
	•	No charge for data in same AZ

54.	Multiple VPCs with Peering?
	Possible but complex.
	Prefer Transit Gateway for >2 VPCs.
55.	Site-to-Site VPN troubleshooting:

	•	Check tunnel status
	•	BGP status
	•	CloudWatch metrics
	•	On-prem firewall rules
	•	VPN logs in CloudWatch
