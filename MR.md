4. **How do you troubleshoot a production issue under pressure?**
   - **Answer**: I prioritize diagnostics and communication. **Situation**: An EKS pod failed during peak traffic. **Task**: Restore service fast. **Action**: Used `kubectl describe pod` to find a networking issue, updated VPC Security Groups, and deployed via Helm. **Result**: Service restored in 45 minutes, with a post-mortem to fix DNS configs. I’d ensure GlobalLogic’s systems stay reliable.

5. **How do you collaborate with developers and clients?**
   - **Answer**: I align on goals and simplify technical updates. **Situation**: Developers struggled with slow CI/CD. **Task**: Improve collaboration. **Action**: Met with devs to identify bottlenecks, implemented Git-based pipelines with CodeBuild, and explained benefits to the client. **Result**: Cut build time by 40%, earning client praise. I’d work with GlobalLogic’s clients to drive value.

6. **How do you automate operational tasks in a DevOps environment?**
   - **Answer**: I use Ansible and Python for efficiency. **Situation**: Manual Linux patching slowed operations. **Task**: Automate it. **Action**: Wrote an Ansible playbook to patch CentOS servers and a Python script to validate updates, triggered via Git. **Result**: Reduced patching time from 4 hours to 30 minutes. I’d automate GlobalLogic’s workflows similarly.

7. **Describe a time you adopted a new technology. How did you adapt?**
   - **Answer**: **Situation**: Needed to implement Helm for EKS. **Task**: Learn and deploy quickly. **Action**: Studied Helm docs, built a chart for a test app, and integrated with AWS CodePipeline. **Result**: Deployed 5 apps in one week, improving reproducibility. I’m eager to explore GlobalLogic’s tech stack, like advanced Ansible or AWS services.

8. **How do you mentor junior DevOps engineers?**
   - **Answer**: I provide hands-on training and feedback. **Situation**: A junior struggled with Docker. **Task**: Build their skills. **Action**: Conducted a workshop on multi-stage builds, paired them on an ECR project, and reviewed their Dockerfile. **Result**: They optimized images independently in 2 weeks. I’d mentor GlobalLogic’s team to excel.

9. **How do you ensure security in AWS and Kubernetes?**
   - **Answer**: I enforce best practices and automation. **Situation**: An EKS cluster had exposed ports. **Task**: Secure it. **Action**: Configured RBAC, used Trivy to scan Docker images, and set up AWS WAF for VPC. Automated checks with Ansible. **Result**: Eliminated 70% of vulnerabilities in one sprint. I’d secure GlobalLogic’s infra similarly.

10. **How do you handle conflicting priorities from clients?**
    - **Answer**: I clarify needs and propose solutions. **Situation**: A client demanded faster deployments, but another needed security audits. **Task**: Balance both. **Action**: Prioritized critical IAM fixes, automated audits with Python, and optimized CI/CD with Git. **Result**: Met both goals in 10 days. I’d manage GlobalLogic’s client priorities effectively.

11. **How do you support a 24/7 roster-based model?**
    - **Answer**: I automate and monitor to minimize manual work. **Situation**: Supported a 24/7 EKS app. **Task**: Ensure uptime. **Action**: Set up CloudWatch alerts, automated scaling with Ansible, and used SNS for notifications. **Result**: Reduced incident response by 50%. I’d adapt to GlobalLogic’s roster with proactive automation.

12. **How do you troubleshoot network issues in AWS?**
    - **Answer**: I systematically diagnose connectivity. **Situation**: An EC2 instance couldn’t reach S3. **Task**: Resolve quickly. **Action**: Checked VPC Security Groups with `aws ec2 describe-security-groups`, fixed inbound rules, and tested with `curl`. **Result**: Restored access in 30 minutes. I’d ensure GlobalLogic’s networking is robust.

13. **How do you stay updated on DevOps technologies?**
    - **Answer**: I follow AWS blogs, CNCF events, and experiment on GitHub. **Situation**: Needed to learn Ansible for automation. **Task**: Adopt it fast. **Action**: Built a playbook for EC2 provisioning in a week, integrating with Git. **Result**: Automated 80% of server setups. I’d keep GlobalLogic’s team ahead with new tools.

14. **Describe a time you failed and how you handled it.**
    - **Answer**: **Situation**: A misconfigured Helm chart delayed a deployment. **Task**: Recover and improve. **Action**: Debugged with `helm template`, fixed values.yaml, and added CI checks with Git. **Result**: Deployed successfully and reduced errors by 25%. I learned to validate configs and would apply this at GlobalLogic.

15. **Why GlobalLogic, and how do you align with this role?**
